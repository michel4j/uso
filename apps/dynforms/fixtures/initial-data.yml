        values:
        - Highly innovative research of great importance which will significantly
          advance knowledge in the field.
        - Research is of very high quality and will likely make a significant contribution
          to a specific scientific discipline.
        - Research is likely to produce publishable results in a specialized journal.
        - ' Research is of limited scope and will not significantly impact a specific
          field and may not result in a publication.'
        - Research is either not well planned, is not feasible, unlikely to result
          in publishable results, or is too poorly described to permit proper judgement
          of its merit.

        - There is no other way to answer the scientific question posed without using
          the CLS beamline requested. The experiment represents optimal use of the
          beamline
        - ' Synchrotron radiation from a third generation source is required for this
          project, and the CLS beamline requested is well suited for this type of
          research.'
        - Synchrotron radiation is required to accomplish the intended goals of the
          research, but either another CLS beamline is a better match, the experiment
          is not taking advantage of the capabilities of a third generation source
          or the experiment is not well suited for the capabilities of the beamline
          at this time
        - The proposal has not adequately justified that a synchrotron experiment
          is required to answer the scientific question. In some cases the proposal
          may be improved by first performing experiments using more conventional
          techniques.
        - There are non-synchrotron methods which should be used to answer this scientific
          question. This is not appropriate use of CLS resources.

        - The applicants have demonstrated a highly productive track record of publishing
          their CLS results in top-tier journals. In the case of researchers new to
          the CLS, they show exceptional potential.
        - ' The applicants have consistently published their CLS results, sometimes
          in top-tier journals. In the case of researchers new to the CLS, there is
          a very high likelihood that these researchers will become highly productive
          users '
        - 'The applicants have a reasonable record of publishing their CLS results
          but rarely in top-tier journals, or they are potentially productive past
          users who have demonstrated that they should be given more time. In the
          case of researchers new to the CLS, they have demonstrated potential for
          becoming productive users. '
        - The researchers have only been marginally productive with previous CLS beamtime
          and there is need for improvement. In the case of researchers new to the
          CLS, their proposal reveals a lack of knowledge of synchrotron experiments,
          and they could benefit from more training and/or mentoring.
        - 'Researchers have received significant beamtime at CLS with an unacceptable
          publication record. '
